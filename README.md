When you send NTC to the given text ICRC top-up address, the NTC will be burned and the canister will receive cycles.

The canister top-up address is permanent. You can publish it on your website for others to top up your canisters with a transaction from their wallets.

If sending to non-existent canister/principal, there are no refunds. Sending will fail. Only send to accounts obtained from get_account.
You could also take the canister2subaccount function and generate these addresses locally.

If sending to unavailable subnet, the request will be retried 11 times - 5 min between retries. If that doesn't work after 55min, the NTC is lost.
